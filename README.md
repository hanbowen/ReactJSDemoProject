Dear Interviewer:

I am making this demo in order to prove my skills in ReactJS. Since I do not have any ReactJS related
project experience in my resume, I hope this demo could help me to let you believe I could do React Project very well.

This demo website aims to provide headlines from more than 50 News websites. The API is provided by [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

This demo has shown following skills:
-Thinking in ReactJS;
-Code structure design;
-Grasp of JSX;
-Understanding of props and states;
-Handling events;
-React routing;
-Axios API requests;
-The use of Reactstrap(Bootstrap module);
-Responsive layout;
-Fluid layout;
-HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge;

At last, I really hope this demo could leave you a good impression. Thanks for your time.

Yours sincerely,
Bowen Han
